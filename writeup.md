What would you do to convert this into a full scale web application:

1. Build a system design document for the project and I will make sure it has all the important elments required in HLD
2. Get design reviewed by mentors and seniors
3. Build a responsive interactive UI
4. Manage pagination in different tabs
5. Make sure that parasing of data would be easy
6. Write test cases to make sure sanity of web application
7. Get review code by seniors and project managers
8. Deployment which includes setting up of CI/CD pipeline
9. Get user feedback(which is very important)
